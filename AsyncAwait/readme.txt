Task.Run: This method schedules a delegate (a method) to run on a ThreadPool thread asynchronously. It returns a Task object representing that operation.

new Action(LongTask): This part creates a delegate (a reference to a method) that points to the LongTask method. It's wrapped inside an Action delegate, which represents a method that takes no arguments and returns void.

await: This keyword is used to asynchronously wait for the completion of a Task. It allows the program to continue executing other tasks while waiting for the asynchronous operation to complete.

Putting it all together:

Task.Run(new Action(LongTask)): This asynchronously runs the LongTask method on a ThreadPool thread.
await Task.Run(new Action(LongTask)): This line asynchronously waits for the Task returned by Task.Run to complete.
In simpler terms, await Task.Run(new Action(LongTask)) means: "Run the LongTask method on a separate thread, and wait for it to finish before continuing." This allows the program to perform tasks concurrently without blocking the main thread.
