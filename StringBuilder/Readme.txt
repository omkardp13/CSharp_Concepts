                                                *--String Builder --*

1.In C#, the StringBuilder class is used for efficiently modifying strings. 

2.Since strings in C# are immutable (i.e., once created, their contents cannot be changed), any modification to a string (like concatenation or replacement) creates 
  a new string, which can be inefficient for operations involving many modifications. 

3.StringBuilder helps solve this problem by allowing mutable strings that can be modified without creating new objects, improving performance in scenarios that 
  require frequent string manipulation.

Key Features of StringBuilder:

1.Efficient String Modifications: It optimizes performance when performing repetitive string concatenation or manipulation.

2.Dynamic Sizing: It automatically grows its internal buffer as needed, without creating new instances like regular strings.

3.Thread Safety: The StringBuilder class is not thread-safe by default. If you need thread-safe operations, you can use StringBuilder with synchronization techniques.
