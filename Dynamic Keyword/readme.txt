The dynamic keyword in C# allows you to bypass compile-time type checking, enabling runtime binding of objects. This can be useful in scenarios where the type of an object or its members is not known until runtime. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its uses and behavior:

Key Features of dynamic:

1.Runtime Binding:

With dynamic, the type checking of the operations you perform on the object happens at runtime, not at compile time.
This allows you to interact with objects without requiring their exact type or members to be known at compile time.
Simplifies Interoperability:

2.COM Interop: Useful when working with COM objects (e.g., Office Interop libraries), where the exact types and members might not be known at compile time.

3.Reflection: Reduces boilerplate code when invoking members dynamically through reflection.

4.Dynamic Languages: Facilitates integration with libraries written in dynamic languages like Python, Ruby, or JavaScript (e.g., using the DLR - Dynamic Language Runtime).

5.Duck Typing:

You can call members on an object without the compiler requiring a specific type, as long as the member exists at runtime.
Handling ExpandoObject and DynamicObject:

The ExpandoObject and DynamicObject classes provide ways to create objects whose members can be dynamically added or removed at runtime. The dynamic keyword works seamlessly with them.
