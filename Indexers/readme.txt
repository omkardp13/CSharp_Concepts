indexers allow an object to be indexed like an array. They are a way to define properties that allow accessing or assigning values using an index. This is useful for classes that represent collections or data structures that require indexed access, such as lists or arrays.

Key Features of Indexers:
Indexer Syntax: An indexer looks like a property but takes parameters, typically for indexing an internal collection.
Custom Access to Class Elements: Indexers allow you to define how an object of a class can be accessed using the [] (square brackets) notation, like an array or a list.
Flexible Indexing: You can define custom logic for getting and setting values based on an index.
