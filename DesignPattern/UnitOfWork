The Unit of Work pattern in ASP.NET Core Web API ensures that a group of operations on the database are treated as a single transaction. 
If one operation fails, all changes can be rolled back, maintaining data consistency. 
This pattern is particularly useful when working with Entity Framework (EF) Core.

Advantages of Unit of Work
1.Transaction Management: Ensures all operations within a request are saved together.
2.Centralized Data Access Logic: Combines multiple repository calls into a single coordinated transaction.
3.Encapsulation: Hides complex logic related to repository instantiation.

Conclusion
The Unit of Work pattern is a powerful way to manage database transactions and encapsulate the interaction with repositories.
It simplifies complex data access scenarios and ensures consistency in your ASP.NET Core Web API.
