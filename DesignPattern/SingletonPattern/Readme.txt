**-------------Singleton Pattern------------**
1.Class has only one instance and provides global point to this instance.
2.This pattern is usefull when exactly one object is needed across the system.
Charactoristics:
1.Private Constructor:Prevent other classes from creating instance of it,
2.Private Instance:Class contains private,static instance itself.
3.Static Access Method:Allows other classes to access single instance.
