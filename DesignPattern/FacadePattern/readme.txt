The Facade Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a larger and more complex subsystem. 
It is particularly useful in ASP.NET Core Web API to encapsulate complex business logic or interactions with multiple services, making the API easier to maintain and use.

example:

Scenario for Using the Facade Pattern in ASP.NET Core Web API
Imagine a Web API that needs to interact with several services or modules, such as:

User Authentication
Order Processing
Payment Gateway Integration
Notification Service
Instead of exposing each of these modules directly to controllers, the Facade pattern can create a single simplified interface for the controller to interact with these subsystems.
