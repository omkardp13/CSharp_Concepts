The Facade Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a larger and more complex subsystem. 
It is particularly useful in ASP.NET Core Web API to encapsulate complex business logic or interactions with multiple services, making the API easier to maintain and use.

example:

Scenario for Using the Facade Pattern in ASP.NET Core Web API
Imagine a Web API that needs to interact with several services or modules, such as:

User Authentication
Order Processing
Payment Gateway Integration
Notification Service
Instead of exposing each of these modules directly to controllers, the Facade pattern can create a single simplified interface for the controller to interact with these subsystems.

Advantages of Using Facade Pattern in Web API

1.Simplifies Controller Logic: The controller does not need to handle interactions with multiple services directly.

2.Encapsulation: Encapsulates the subsystem's complexities and exposes only the necessary functionality.

3.Maintainability: Changes in subsystems require minimal changes to the controller.

4.Reusability: The Facade class can be reused in multiple controllers or services.

Summary
The Facade Design Pattern in ASP.NET Core Web API simplifies complex interactions between controllers and subsystems. By centralizing logic into a Facade class, it makes the application more modular, maintainable, and easier to understand.
