1.Namespace: System.Collections

2.When to Use: When you have an in-memory collection or when you’re working with data that doesn’t need to be queried at the database level.

3.Execution: Deferred execution but in-memory. This means that all filtering, ordering, or projections are done in memory after loading the data.

4.Best For: Small collections where all data can be loaded into memory.
